# DataStructure-Algorithms

This Repository will be used to record implementations of some data structures and algorithms.

## Motivation

For some complicated algorithms like [Boyerâ€“Moore string-search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm), it is really hard to find a good and integrity implementations: some of them just implemented the bad character rule, others just implement good suffix rule. 

I am very interested in those algorthms, so while I implemented it, I want to share with you for your reference.

## Implementation

All implementations will be C++.

## Test

Will test those implementations by [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or hands.

## Algorithms Explanations

The explanations will be simple and short, just for my reference.

However, if you found anything wrong/unclear feel free to contact me here.
